Iain's User Page

My name is Iain Ro, I am currently a 4th year student at UC San Diego, currently majoring in Computer Science. Learning about Software Engineering is very interesting, and is helpful for creating different projects I am passionate about. Outside of computer science, I am very interested in writing, and learning about how to create stories, such as in making games.
